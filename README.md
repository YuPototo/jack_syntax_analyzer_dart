# Jack Syntax Analyzer

## Usage

```bash
dart bin/main.dart <input-path>
```

Input path can be a file or a directory. If it is a directory, all files with the extension `.jack` will be processed.

`.xml` files are written to the same directory as the input file.

## Assumption

- The input file is a valid Jack file.
